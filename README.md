# Button-LED-Control_ON_OFF
This Arduino project controls an LED using a button. Initially, the LED is OFF. Each button press toggles the LED stateâ€”ON when pressed, OFF when pressed again. The project uses an internal pull-up resistor and includes a debounce delay to ensure reliable button press detection and accurate LED control.
